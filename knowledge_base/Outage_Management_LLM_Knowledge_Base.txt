5. Safety Protocols:
   - Advise customers to stay away from downed power lines and report any potential electrical hazards immediately.
   - Provide guidance on safe generator usage, avoiding carbon monoxide poisoning, and other safety precautions during prolonged outages.

6. Crew Deployment and Coordination:
